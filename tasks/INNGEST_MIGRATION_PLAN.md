# Inngest Migration to GitHub Actions Plan

## Executive Summary

**NOTE: This plan has been superseded by the hybrid approach in `HYBRID_PROGRESSIVE_CAPTURE_PLAN.md`.**

This task outlines the complete migration from the current Inngest-based progressive data capture system to the GitHub Actions approach detailed in `GITHUB_ACTIONS.md`. This migration will eliminate external dependencies, reduce costs by 40-88%, and provide better observability while maintaining all current functionality.

**RECOMMENDED APPROACH**: See `HYBRID_PROGRESSIVE_CAPTURE_PLAN.md` for a better solution that uses Inngest for recent data (< 24hrs) and GitHub Actions for historical data, providing optimal user experience and cost efficiency.

## Context

### Current State
The Inngest system has been optimized with rate limiting fixes (see `RATE_LIMITING_FIXES.md`) but still has fundamental limitations:
- External service dependency on Inngest
- Limited debugging capabilities
- Scaling costs with usage
- Complex local development setup

### Target State
GitHub Actions-based system following the hearts/jobs pattern:
- No external dependencies
- Native GitHub integration
- Cost-effective ($0-24/month vs $40-200/month)
- Excellent observability through GitHub UI

## Migration Plan

## Monitoring & Rollback Plan

### Success Metrics
- [ ] 99.5% job success rate
- [ ] Average job completion time < 5 minutes
- [ ] Zero rate limiting errors
- [ ] Cost reduction of 40-88%
- [ ] User experience unchanged

### Rollback Triggers
- Job success rate < 95%
- Average job time > 10 minutes
- More than 5 rate limiting errors per day
- User complaints about performance

### Rollback Procedure
1. Switch feature flag back to Inngest
2. Restart Inngest services
3. Re-queue failed jobs in Inngest
